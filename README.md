# ProjectManagementApp

Back in college I had worked on a project with a group of developers. We had client who had requested
us to build a app that would help him manage the development of his project, think of Jira or Flyingdonut,
but not as robust. We had built it using the FERN stack (similar to the MERN stack but instead of MongoDB we used Firebase). There were a few things that I was not happy with about it, but I can only look back on it now and think about how to properly build the application. I had decided to rebuild it using my current knowledge and expertise. I am developing it using Spring Boot, if you know Java thatn Spring Boot will be a welcome addition to you. For the front end I shall be using React.js but that may be subject to change. I am going to be storing the data for the application on Google Cloud in a MySQL database.
