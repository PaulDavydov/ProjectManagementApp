# ProjectManagementApp

Back in college I had worked on a project with a group of guys. We had client who had requested
us to build a app that would help him manage the development of his project, think of jira,
but not as robust. We had built it using Node Express and React. I am currently trying to 
recreate it using Spring Boot and React/Next. There are additional thing that I am adding,
but I will add them at a later date in this read.me
